<h5>HINTS FOR EACH QUESTION</h5>
<li>1. Matrix Zeroes:

  2. Pascal's Triangle
  <ul>Numbers in the pascal's triangle correspond to the binomial coefficients</ul>
  <ul>The n'th row in the pascal's triangle represents the coefficients of expansion (a+b)^n </ul>
  <ul>You might notice that they do (n-1) C (r-1) that is because in programming languages indexing starts from 0.</ul>
  <ul>The binomial coefficient often represented as (n,k) meaning choose k from n. represents the number of ways to choose <i>k</i> elements from <i>n</i> elements</ul>
  <ul>
    <p>Vector in Java deals more with concurrent access and synchronization among threads in a single program rather than parallelism or distribution across multiple systems.

Parallel computing involves performing multiple computations simultaneously, typically on different parts of the data or using multiple processing units. Distributed computing, on the other hand, involves multiple systems or computers working together on a task, often across a network.

In the case of Vector, it manages concurrent access among threads in a single program by allowing them to access and modify it in a synchronized manner, ensuring thread safety. It doesn't distribute the tasks across different systems; rather, it synchronizes access among threads within the same program.

So, Vector deals more with concurrency and thread safety within a program rather than parallelism or distribution across different systems.</p>
